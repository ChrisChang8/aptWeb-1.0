            This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect through: (1)
            this website referred to herein as “Property Owner", "we", "us", or
            "our", (2) mobile applications, (3) hardware devices in units or
            otherwise on our properties, (4) other websites and other services
            we own, operate, or make available and that link to the Privacy
            Policy and (5) to all other general enquiries we receive (including
            postal mail, electronic mail and telephone requests) (collectively
            the “Services”). “Affiliate” means with respect to a party, any
            person or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
            common control with that party, where “control” means the power to
            direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such
            entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
            contract, or otherwise. Property Owner recognizes the importance
            of protecting the privacy of individual-specific information that
            identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being
            associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
            indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (“Personal
            Information”) particularly our consumer users (referred to as
            "you" or "your" in this Privacy Policy). This Privacy Policy
            describes what Personal Information we gather, how we use it, how
            it is shared and how you can correct, change and limit our use of
            it. If you are asked to submit registration details via our
            Services, you may be requested to agree to additional terms
            regarding our use of your Personal Information, and those
            additional terms will apply in that context. Any additional terms
            will be available for your review at the time of registration. We
            encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before you send or share
            Personal Information with us or use our Services. We also
            encourage you to read it again when you return to our websites.
